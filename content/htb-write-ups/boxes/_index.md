Boxes are virtual machines hosted on HTB that are designed to be exploited. The
goal is to find *flags* (special strings) proving that we have successfully
hacked... the box. ðŸ˜‰

Also referred to as a *machine* or a *target*, each HTB box represents a
simulated computer system with a specific set of vulnerabilities and bad
security practices. These boxes vary in terms of difficulty, and are categorized
into different levels based on the complexity of the attack chains and the
skills required to compromise them:

- **Very easy**
- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Insane**

A full list of available HTB boxes can be found

Below are my write-ups for the boxes I completed.
