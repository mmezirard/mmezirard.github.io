# Information

**Difficulty**: Very easy

**Category**: Reversing

**Release date**: 2023-04-28

**Created by**: [clubby789](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/83743)

**Description**: Deep in an ancient tomb, you've discovered a stone tablet with
secret information on the locations of other relics. However, while dodging a
poison dart, it slipped from your hands and shattered into hundreds of pieces.
Can you reassemble it and read the clues?

# Setup

I'll complete this challenge using a Kali Linux VM. I'll create a `workspace`
directory at `/` to hold all the files related to this challenge, and the
commands ran on my machine will be prefixed with `‚ùØ` for clarity.

# Files

```sh
‚ùØ tree -a "/workspace"
```

```
/workspace
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rev_shattered_tablet
 ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tablet

<SNIP>
```

This challenge is comprised of a single file named `tablet`.

# Static analysis

Let's start by statically analyzing the `tablet` file using the Rizin toolkit.

## Properties

Let's inspect the properties of this file.

```sh
‚ùØ file "/workspace/rev_shattered_tablet/tablet"
```

```
tablet: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=71ad3ff9f7e5fbf0edc75446337a0a68deb7ecd6, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

This is an ELF 64-bit, LSB executable.

## Libraries

Let's find out which libraries are used by this binary.

```sh
‚ùØ rz-bin -l "/workspace/rev_shattered_tablet/tablet"
```

```
[Libs]
library   
----------
libc.so.6
```

This binary uses the `libc.so.6` library, which provides the fundamental
functionalities for programs written in C.

## Imports

Now, let's find the list of objects imported by this binary.

```sh
‚ùØ rz-bin -i "/workspace/rev_shattered_tablet/tablet"
```

```
[Imports]
nth vaddr      bind   type   lib name                        
-------------------------------------------------------------
1   ---------- WEAK   NOTYPE     _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
2   0x00001030 GLOBAL FUNC       puts
3   0x00001040 GLOBAL FUNC       printf
4   ---------- GLOBAL FUNC       __libc_start_main
5   0x00001050 GLOBAL FUNC       fgets
6   ---------- WEAK   NOTYPE     __gmon_start__
7   ---------- WEAK   NOTYPE     _ITM_registerTMCloneTable
8   0x00001060 WEAK   FUNC       __cxa_finalize
```

This binary imports functions like `puts`, but also `fgets`, so we can expect to
see text printed to the terminal and to be asked for input.

## Strings

Finally, let's retrieve the list of strings contained in this binary.

```sh
‚ùØ rz-bin -z "/workspace/rev_shattered_tablet/tablet"
```

```
[Strings]
nth paddr      vaddr      len size section type  string                             
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   0x00002008 0x00002008 34  35   .rodata ascii Hmmmm... I think the tablet says: 
1   0x0000202b 0x0000202b 18  19   .rodata ascii Yes! That's right!
2   0x0000203e 0x0000203e 14  15   .rodata ascii No... not that
```

# Dynamic analysis

Now that we have an idea of what this binary could be doing, let's see what it
really does.

## Execution

Let's execute this binary on Linux.

```sh
‚ùØ "/workspace/rev_shattered_tablet/tablet"
```

```
Hmmmm... I think the tablet says:
```

We're asked to enter what the tablet says. I don't know what it's supposed to
say though, so I'll just enter something random:

```
Hmmmm... I think the tablet says: hello?
No... not that
```

# Static analysis

## Decompilation

I'll load `tablet` with the default options using Binary Ninja.

As usual, I'll start by exploring the `main` function.

### `main`

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {
    char input[64];
    memset(input, 0, sizeof(input));
    printf("Hmmmm... I think the tablet says‚Ä¶");
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    if (input[0] != 'H' || input[1] != 'T' || input[2] != 'B' ||
        input[3] != '{' || input[4] != 'b' || input[5] != 'r' ||
        input[6] != '0' || input[7] != 'k' || input[8] != '3' ||
        input[9] != 'n' || input[10] != '_' || input[11] != '4' ||
        input[12] != 'p' || input[13] != '4' || input[14] != 'r' ||
        input[15] != 't' || input[16] != '.' || input[17] != '.' ||
        input[18] != '.' || input[19] != 'n' || input[20] != '3' ||
        input[21] != 'v' || input[22] != 'e' || input[23] != 'r' ||
        input[24] != '_' || input[25] != 't' || input[26] != '0' ||
        input[27] != '_' || input[28] != 'b' || input[29] != '3' ||
        input[30] != '_' || input[31] != 'r' || input[32] != '3' ||
        input[33] != 'p' || input[34] != '4' || input[35] != '1' ||
        input[36] != 'r' || input[37] != '3' || input[38] != 'd' ||
        input[39] != '}') {
        puts("No... not that");
    } else {
        puts("Yes! That's right!");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

HTB{br0k3n_4p4rt...n3ver_t0_b3_r3p41r3d}

# Putting it all together

The user input is compared against many indivual characters.

If we concatenate all these characters, we obtain the flag
`HTB{br0k3n_4p4rt...n3ver_t0_b3_r3p41r3d}`!

If we run the binary once again and input this string, we get the message
`Yes! That's right!`, which confirms that this is the flag.

# Afterwords

![Success](success.png)

That's it for this box! üéâ

I rated this challenge as 'Very easy'. The decompiled code was really close to
the reality, and it was easy to understand. It was just annoying to sort the
comparisons in the correct order and to find the characters corresponding to the
hexadecimal values.

Thanks for reading!
