Challenges are atomic cybersecurity puzzles. Unlike boxes, challenges are much
shorter to complete and focus on a single hacking field. The goal is also to
find *flags* (special strings) proving that we have successfully completed the
challenge.

Challenges come in four difficulties:

- **Very easy**
- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**

HTB hosts many kinds of challenges, ranging from very hands-on to much more
conceptual ones:

- **Blockchain**
- **Crypto**
- **Forensics**
- **GamePwn**
- **Hardware**
- **Misc**
- **Mobile**
- **OSINT**
- **Pwn**
- **Reversing**
- **Web**

Currently, there is no way to see a full list of HTB challenges other than
logging in into HTB and browsing the 'Challenges' section.

Below are my write-ups for the challenges I completed.
