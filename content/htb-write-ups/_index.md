[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), abbreviated as *HTB*, brands itself
as:

> The #1 cybersecurity upskilling platform.

This is an online platform that provides a wide range of cybersecurity
challenges and simulated environments for individuals to practice and improve
their hacking skills, penetration testing abilities, and overall cybersecurity
knowledge. HTB is designed to be a hands-on and immersive platform where users
can learn by doing.

This section regroups a collection of the write-ups I wrote when completing the
content available on HTB.
